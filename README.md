# Property_Price_Prediction
There are a number of factors which determine property prices, some are logical, based on economic theories and population density and some are based on more intangible factors, like availability of amenities & necessities, neighborhood, etc. 

In this we build a linear regression model with stochastic gradient descent to predict the price of the property from the dataset having attributes such as sale type, sale condition etc.
